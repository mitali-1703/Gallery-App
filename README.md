# Gallery-App
This is a simple Gallery Application to display images with labels.

## With this application I have learnt various concepts, such as:
* Implementing Dialogs & Actions Menu

* Fetching image from internet & mobile gallery

* Fetching labels and palette for image using ML model

* Dynamic Views

* Asynchronous Task(Background thread)

* Share Image using intent

* Get bitmap of any view

* Custom callbacks/listeners

* Ripple Click effect

* Hide Android keyboard programatically

* Get Redirected URL (without following the complete path)

* Use of JSON

* Use of custom call backs

* Use of Shared Preferences on configuration changes

* Add Contextual menu to the views

* Add images from device

* Share image & Share screenshot of card

* Universal Loader

* Recycler View

* Searching and sorting in the list

* Drag and Drop to rearrange items in list

* Swipe to remove item in list

## Have a run at it with the [APK](https://github.com/mitali-1703/Gallery-App/releases/download/latest/app-debug.apk) here!
